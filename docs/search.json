Many individuals at high risk of fracture remain unidentified under current age-based screening guidelines, particularly those who present with clinical or lifestyle risk factors but do not meet standard screening age thresholds.\nPhase 1 of this project used secondary population data (smoking, physical activity, body measurements, prior fracture history) to identify individuals at elevated bone-health risk and to quantify the proportion of high-risk individuals who are not captured by current screening criteria. This revealed a substantial “missed high-risk” population who may benefit from earlier identification and intervention.\nPhase 2 builds on these findings by simulating the clinical and commercial impact of a hypothetical osteoporosis treatment if this missed high-risk population were successfully identified and treated. The purpose of this phase is to demonstrate how screening improvements could translate into improved clinical outcomes and potential commercial value in a realistic biopharmaceutical analytics context.\n\nPhase 1 summary\nIndividuals were classified as high bone risk in Phase 1 using a lumbar spine T-score–led definition. Participants with a lumbar spine T-score in the osteoporosis range (≤ −2.5) were classified as high risk regardless of other factors. Participants with a lumbar spine T-score in the osteopenia range (between −1.0 and −2.5) were classified as high risk only if at least one additional risk indicator was present. Risk indicators included low body mass index, current or former smoking, a history of fracture at the hip, wrist, or spine, or low levels of physical activity. This approach recognizes that moderately reduced bone density becomes more important when combined with other risk factors.\nThe Phase 1 analysis was conducted using data from 3,107 individuals in the NHANES 2005–2006 cohort, all aged 20 years or older. Among this study population, 540 individuals were classified as high-risk for osteoporosis based on bone mineral density (BMD) and additional clinical or lifestyle risk factors. Importantly, 508 of these high-risk individuals were not identified under current age- and guideline-based screening criteria. This represents approximately 16.35% of the total study population, highlighting a substantial “missed high-risk” group.\nNHANES employs a complex, multistage probability sampling design, meaning raw sample proportions cannot be interpreted as nationally representative without adjustment. Therefore, survey weights (WTMEC2YR), strata (SDMVSTRA), and primary sampling units (SDMVPSU) were applied to account for oversampling and clustering within the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey framework. After incorporating these design elements, the weighted prevalence of missed high-risk adults was 15.22%. This survey-adjusted estimate provides a nationally representative prevalence that can be used to project the number of U.S. adults aged ≥20 who may fall into this under-identified high-risk category today.\nApplying the weighted prevalence estimate of 15.22% to the current U.S. adult population aged ≥20 (approximately 250 million individuals based on recent Census age distributions) suggests that roughly:\n250,000,000 × 0.1522 = 38,050,000\n≈ 38 million U.S. adults may fall into this expanded high-risk category yet remain unidentified under current age-based screening criteria.\nFrom a public health and commercial perspective, these individuals represent a potentially addressable market for osteoporosis screening and treatment interventions. By targeting this missed population, there is an opportunity to improve early detection, initiate timely therapy, and potentially reduce fracture risk, while also quantifying the market potential for a treatment like OsteoGuard.\n\n\nShow code\n# Reading in data from phase 1\nphase_1 &lt;- read_xpt(\"data/poe_bone_health_phase1 - 2026.02.12.xpt\")\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Pie chart\n# Counts\ntotal_count &lt;- nrow(phase_1) \nhigh_risk_count &lt;- sum(phase_1$high_bone_risk == 1)\nmissed_high_risk_count &lt;- sum(phase_1$missed_high_risk == 1)\n\n# Preparing df\npie_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  group = c( \"High Risk and Screened\", \"Missed High Risk\", \"Not at Risk\"),\n  count = c(high_risk_count - missed_high_risk_count,\n            missed_high_risk_count,\n            total_count - high_risk_count)\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    percent = round(count / sum(count) * 100, 1),\n    label = paste0(group, \": \", count, \" (\", percent, \"%)\"),\n    ymax = cumsum(count),\n    ymin = c(0, head(ymax, n = -1)),\n    mid = (ymax + ymin) / 2\n  )\n\n# Rendering plot\npie_data  %&lt;&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    label_y = case_when(\n      group == \"High Risk and Screened\"        ~ mid,   # middle of wedge\n      group == \"Missed High Risk\" ~ ymax,  # top of wedge\n      group == \"Not at Risk\"      ~ mid    # middle of wedge\n    ),\n    label_x = case_when(\n      group == \"Missed High Risk\" ~ 5.4,   # push to the right\n      TRUE                        ~ 4.5    # default for others\n    )\n  )\n\n\nggplot(pie_data, aes(ymax = ymax, ymin = ymin, xmax = 4, xmin = 3, fill = group)) +\n  geom_rect(color = \"white\") +\n  geom_label(\n    aes(x = label_x, y = label_y, label = label, fill = group),\n    color = \"white\",\n    show.legend = FALSE,\n    label.size = 0.2\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#E0B6E4\", \"#9A4EAE\", \"#7E3285\")) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\", clip = \"off\")+\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Phase 1 Study Population Breakdown: Osteoporosis Risk (N = 3107)\",\n    fill = \"Group\"\n  )+ \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.margin = margin(t = 10, r = 80, b = 10, l = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteoGuard\nFor the purposes of this analysis, a hypothetical osteoporosis therapy, OsteoGuard, is introduced. OsteoGuard is modelled as a bisphosphonate-like treatment designed to improve bone mineral density and reduce fracture risk in high-risk individuals.\nThe simulated treatment is assumed to behave similarly to established bisphosphonates used in clinical practice. These therapies are known to increase lumbar spine bone mineral density, reduce fracture risk, and slow the progression from osteopenia to osteoporosis when adherence is maintained. OsteoGuard is assumed to be prescribed to individuals classified as high bone-health risk in Phase 1, with particular focus on those who would otherwise be missed under current screening guidelines.\nAll clinical and commercial data used in this phase are simulated but grounded in published literature and typical real-world treatment patterns to ensure plausibility.\n\n\n\nOsteoGuard Efficacy\nThe simulation of OsteoGuard treatment outcomes was informed by established clinical norms, Phase 1 study population parameters, published bisphosphonate efficacy studies, and pragmatic assumptions regarding adherence, safety, and commercial context.\nThe table below summarises all key modelling assumptions and their sources to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability of the simulated clinical and economic outcomes.\n\n\nShow code\n# Assumptions table\nassumptions_tbl &lt;- tribble(\n  ~Section, ~Parameter, ~Assumption, ~Reference, ~`Why it's reasonable`,\n\n  #Baseline clinical norms\n  \"Baseline clinical norms\", \"T-score interpretation: Normal\", \"&gt;= -1.0\", \"Clinical DXA conventions\",\n  \"Standard clinical threshold used in DXA reporting.\",\n  \"Baseline clinical norms\", \"T-score interpretation: Osteopenia\", \"-1.0 to -2.5\", \"Clinical DXA conventions\",\n  \"Widely accepted range indicating low bone mass and higher future fracture risk.\",\n  \"Baseline clinical norms\", \"T-score interpretation: Osteoporosis\", \"&lt;= -2.5\", \"Clinical DXA conventions\",\n  \"Standard diagnostic threshold used across guidelines and trials.\",\n\n  # Phase 1 study population baselines\n  \"Phase 1 study population parameters\", \"Mean lumbar T-score (high risk)\", \"-1.73\", \"Phase 1 analytic dataset\",\n  \"Empirical mean from the Phase 1 high-risk cohort;

Summary statistics include mean BMD at 24 months, percentage change from baseline, and adherence-stratified comparisons to illustrate the impact of treatment and adherence on bone health.\nThe following table summarizes lumbar spine BMD at baseline and 24 months across adherence groups. It includes the mean and standard deviation at each time point, as well as the percentage change from baseline, providing a clear view of treatment-related bone gains. Higher percentage increases in the high adherence group illustrate the efficacy of the study drug relative to lower adherence, discontinued and control groups.\n\n\nShow code\n# Summarize baseline, 24-month BMD, and percent change by adherence group\ndata %&lt;&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    adherence_group_updated = case_when(\n      treatment_group == \"Control\" ~ \"Control\",\n      discontinued == 1 ~ \"Discontinued\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(adherence_group)\n    ),\n    adherence_group_updated = factor(adherence_group_updated,\n                              levels = c(\"Control\", \"Poor\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", \"Discontinued\"))\n  ) \n\nbmd_summary &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  group_by(adherence_group_updated) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    `Baseline BMD (g/cm²)` = mean(DXXLSBMD, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Baseline SD` = sd(DXXLSBMD, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `24-Month BMD (g/cm²)` = mean(bmd_spine_24m, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `24-Month SD` = sd(bmd_spine_24m, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `Percent Change (%)` = mean((bmd_spine_24m - DXXLSBMD) / DXXLSBMD * 100, na.rm = TRUE),\n    `n` = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n    rename(`Adherence Group` = adherence_group_updated)\n\n# Render the table\nkbl(bmd_summary,\n    caption = \"Lumbar Spine BMD at Baseline and 24 Months by Adherence Group\",\n    digits = 3) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c(\"condensed\", \"hover\"))\n\n\n\nLumbar Spine BMD at Baseline and 24 Months by Adherence Group\n\n\nAdherence Group\nBaseline BMD (g/cm²)\nBaseline SD\n24-Month BMD (g/cm²)\n24-Month SD\nPercent Change (%)\nn\n\n\n\n\nControl\n0.858\n0.067\n0.845\n0.066\n-1.552\n254\n\n\nPoor\n0.867\n0.073\n0.881\n0.076\n1.604\n39\n\n\nModerate\n0.857\n0.073\n0.887\n0.076\n3.439\n62\n\n\nHigh\n0.846\n0.068\n0.892\n0.072\n5.359\n87\n\n\nDiscontinued\n0.855\n0.065\n0.864\n0.067\n1.073\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Preparing data in long format for plotting\nplot_df &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(treatment_group, DXXLSBMD, bmd_spine_12m, bmd_spine_24m,\n         tscore_spine, tscore_spine_12m, tscore_spine_24m) %&gt;%\n  rename(\n    bmd_baseline = DXXLSBMD,\n    tscore_baseline = tscore_spine\n  ) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -treatment_group,\n    names_to = c(\"Metric\", \"Time\"),\n    names_pattern = \"([a-z]+).*_?(baseline|12m|24m)$\",\n    values_to = \"Value\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Time = factor(Time, levels = c(\"baseline\", \"12m\", \"24m\")))\n\n\nThe below line plots provides a visual demonstration of this relationship, showing the average lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and the average lumbar spine T-scores over baseline, 12 months, and 24 months for the treatment and control groups, with standard error bars.

High adherence patients increased from 0.846g/cm² at baseline to 0.892g/cm² at 24 months, representing a 5.4% increase, while moderate and poor adherence groups showed smaller gains of 3.4% and 1.6%, respectively. Discontinued patients had a modest 1.1% increase, whereas the control group declined slightly from 0.858g/cm² to 0.845g/cm² (−1.6%), reflecting stable or deteriorating bone health without therapy.\nThese differences highlight the efficacy of the study drug in improving skeletal outcomes. Coupled with lower simulated fracture incidence in the treated cohort, these results provide a clear foundation for the commercial simulation: treatment benefits translate into measurable risk reduction, inform the addressable population, and support revenue projections. The next phase models how enhanced screening and treatment adoption propagate these health gains into financial and market impact.\n\n\n\nCommercial Analytics\nThe commercial analytics section translates the simulated clinical trial into market-focused insights. Using the estimated addressable population, screening eligibility, and treatment uptake assumptions, this analysis models drug costs, revenue potential, and market size. The objective is to quantify how the therapy could perform commercially based on population-level adoption and projected patient numbers, providing a foundation for financial and strategic decision-making.\n\nSimulating commercial data\nSimilarly to the clinical treatment assumptions, various assumptions were made in order to model the commercial aspects of this project. The below table outlines the key assumptions used in the OsteoGuard market simulation, including treatment pricing, manufacturing costs, and projected market uptake.

The model scales from the estimated 38 million adults aged ≥20 who are currently high-risk but not captured under existing age-based screening criteria, of which approximately 50% are realistically treatable (~19 million).\nMonthly patient starts are initialized at 10,000, reflecting a conservative early adoption launch, and new patient uptake is modeled as a fraction of the remaining untreated pool (0.8% per month), adjusted for the drug’s logistic market share ramp from 8% to 20% over 5 years. Active patients are updated monthly using a persistence factor of 97% per month (~70% annual retention), reflecting real-world discontinuation rates for oral bisphosphonates. Revenue is calculated as active patients multiplied by the monthly treatment price ($10.49), while costs combine manufacturing ($1.04 per patient per month) and one-time customer acquisition costs ($100 per new patient). The simulation horizon is 5 years, and adoption is assumed to increase gradually before plateauing at 50% of the eligible treatable population. This approach provides a data-driven estimate of the addressable market, demonstrating how expanded screening and optimized treatment adoption could translate into measurable economic impact over a realistic commercial rollout period.\n\n\nShow code\n# Simulating commercial dataset\n\n# Inputs\nmonths &lt;- 0:60                    # 5 years\naddressable_pool &lt;- 0.5*38000000  # 50% of 38M\nstart_patients &lt;- 10000           # assumption of realistic starting point\nmonthly_conversion &lt;- 0.008       # 0.8% of untreated pool per month\ninitial_share &lt;- 0.08\nmax_share &lt;- 0.20\nshare_ramp_speed &lt;- 0.06           # logistic ramp\nmonthly_persistence &lt;- 0.97       # ~70% annual\n\nprice_per_month &lt;- 10.49\ncostprice_per_month &lt;- 1.04\nCAC &lt;- 100\n\n# Initialize dataframe\ncommercial_df &lt;- data.frame(month = months) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    market_share = max_share / (1 + exp(-share_ramp_speed * (month - 18))),\n    untreated_pool = NA,\n    new_patients = NA,\n    active_patients = NA\n  )\n\n# Simulation loop\nuntreated &lt;- addressable_pool\nactive &lt;- start_patients\n\nfor (m in 1:nrow(commercial_df)) {\n  share &lt;- commercial_df$market_share[m]\n  \n  # Total new treated patients in the market this month\n  total_new_market &lt;- untreated * monthly_conversion\n  \n  # Patients captured by our drug\n  new_pts &lt;- total_new_market * share\n  \n  # Update active patients with attrition\n  active &lt;- active * monthly_persistence + new_pts\n  \n  # Update untreated pool\n  untreated &lt;- untreated - total_new_market\n  \n  commercial_df$new_patients[m] &lt;- new_pts\n  commercial_df$active_patients[m] &lt;- active\n  commercial_df$untreated_pool[m] &lt;- untreated\n}\n\n# Calculate revenue, cost, profit\ncommercial_df &lt;- commercial_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    revenue = active_patients * price_per_month,\n    cost = (active_patients * costprice_per_month) + (new_patients * CAC),\n    profit = revenue - cost\n  )\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe commercial analysis quantifies projected market performance of OsteoGuard over key time points. Using the estimated addressable population of 38 million, treatment uptake, and pricing assumptions, this summary focuses on captured patients, revenue, costs, and profit at months 1, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60.\nThe per-patient monthly economics for OsteoGuard are shown below. Each patient generates approximately $10.49 in revenue per month, with an estimated manufacturing and distribution cost of $1.04, resulting in a monthly profit of $9.45 per patient excluding acquisition costs. These figures highlight the strong unit economics of the therapy, providing a foundation for projecting cumulative revenue and profit as treatment uptake grows.\n\n\nShow code\n# Monthly economics per patient\n# Define per-patient monthly economics\nper_patient_tbl &lt;- tibble(\n  `Parameter` = c(\"Monthly revenue per patient\", \n                  \"Monthly manufacturing/distribution cost per patient\", \n                  \"Monthly profit per patient\"),\n  `Value ($)` = c(price_per_month, costprice_per_month, price_per_month - costprice_per_month)\n)\n\n# Render the table with kable\nper_patient_tbl %&gt;%\n  kbl(\n    caption = \"Per-Patient Monthly Economics for OsteoGuard\",\n    digits = 2,\n    align = c(\"l\", \"r\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\n    full_width = FALSE,\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"condensed\", \"hover\"),\n    position = \"left\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = \"#f5f5f5\") %&gt;%\n  column_spec(1, bold = F, width = \"18em\") %&gt;%\n  column_spec(2, width = \"8em\")\n\n\n\nPer-Patient Monthly Economics for OsteoGuard\n\n\nParameter\nValue ($)\n\n\n\n\nMonthly revenue per patient\n10.49\n\n\nMonthly manufacturing/distribution cost per patient\n1.04\n\n\nMonthly profit per patient\n9.45\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this per patient profit per month and an estimation of Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) we can calculate the ratio of cost to lifetime value (LTV).

This produces a strong CAC:LTV ratio (5.67), suggesting that for every dollar spent acquiring a patient, the therapy is projected to return about $5.67 in profit — highlighting solid commercial potential under the current assumptions.\n\n\nShow code\n# CAC:LTV\n# Known values\nmonthly_profit &lt;- 9.45         # $ per patient\navg_treatment_months &lt;- 60     # 5 years\nCAC &lt;- 100                      # assumed per patient acquisition cost\n\n\n# Calculate Lifetime Value\nLTV &lt;- monthly_profit * avg_treatment_months\n\n# Calculate CAC:LTV ratio\nCAC_LTV_ratio &lt;- LTV / CAC\n\n\n# Build a data frame\nfinancial_summary &lt;- data.frame(\n  Parameter = c(\"Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)\",\n                \"Profit per Patient per Month\",\n                \"Average Treatment Duration (months)\",\n                \"Lifetime Value (LTV)\",\n                \"CAC:LTV Ratio\"),\n  Value = c(CAC,\n            monthly_profit,\n            avg_treatment_months,\n            round(LTV, 2),\n            round(CAC_LTV_ratio, 2))\n)\n\n# Display as a kable table\nkable(financial_summary, \n      caption = \"Financial Summary for OsteoGuard Phase 2 Simulation\",\n      col.names = c(\"Metric\", \"Value ($)\"),\n      align = c(\"l\",\"r\"))\n\n\n\nFinancial Summary for OsteoGuard Phase 2 Simulation\n\n\nMetric\nValue ($)\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Acquisition Cost (CAC)\n100.00\n\n\nProfit per Patient per Month\n9.45\n\n\nAverage Treatment Duration (months)\n60.00\n\n\nLifetime Value (LTV)\n567.00\n\n\nCAC:LTV Ratio\n5.67\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table presents the projected commercial performance of the new bisphosphonate therapy over a 5-year horizon at selected key months (1, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60).\nAt the start of the simulation, the active patient population is approximately 24,877, generating $260,957 in monthly revenue, though total costs of $825,110 result in an initial loss of $564,152.\nBy the end of the first year (month 12), active patients grow to 111,691, with revenue reaching $1.17 million and losses reduced to just $79,039.\nOver the subsequent years, continued patient uptake and retention drive revenue and profit growth, with 213,899 active patients by month 24, producing $2.24 million in revenue and $544,627 in profit.\nBy month 36, the patient base reaches 313,361, revenue rises to $3.29 million, and profit exceeds $1.26 million. At month 48, 396,353 patients are actively treated, generating $4.16 million in revenue and $1.97 million in profit, and by the end of year five (month 60), the therapy supports 454,632 active patients, $4.77 million in revenue, and $2.56 million in profit.\nThe simulation illustrates a realistic adoption curve, where initial losses from customer acquisition costs are offset by steady growth in active patients and revenue, with profitability achieved during the second year and sustained thereafter, highlighting the economic potential of expanding treatment to previously under-identified high-risk adults.\n\n\nShow code\n# Summary table\nsummary_table &lt;- commercial_df %&gt;%\n  filter(month %in% c(1, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60)) %&gt;%  # select key months\n  transmute(\n    Month = month,\n    `Active Patients` = round(active_patients),\n    `Revenue ($)` = round(revenue, 1),\n    `Cost ($)` = round(cost, 1),\n    `Profit ($)` = round(profit, 1)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kbl(caption = \"Commercial Summary at Key Months\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c(\"condensed\", \"hover\"))\n\nsummary_table\n\n\n\nCommercial Summary at Key Months\n\n\nMonth\nActive Patients\nRevenue ($)\nCost ($)\nProfit ($)\n\n\n\n\n1\n24877\n260957.3\n825109.7\n-564152.4\n\n\n12\n111691\n1171641.7\n1250680.5\n-79038.8\n\n\n24\n213899\n2243804.8\n1699177.7\n544627.2\n\n\n36\n313361\n3287158.5\n2025391.4\n1261767.1\n\n\n48\n396353\n4157739.8\n2186382.0\n1971357.7\n\n\n60\n454632\n4769087.1\n2210479.3\n2558607.8\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on the per-patient and aggregated financial summaries, the below figure illustrates the projected financial performance of the new bisphosphonate therapy over a 5-year (60-month) horizon.\nRevenue (dark purple line) steadily increases as the patient base grows, reaching nearly $5 million by month 60.\nCosts (lighter purple line) rise initially due to both manufacturing expenses and one-time customer acquisition costs (CAC), then plateau around $2.2 million as new patient starts slow and the active patient pool stabilizes.\nProfit (medium purple line) starts negative due to upfront CAC investments but steadily improves, crossing into profitability between months 20 and 25. By year 5, projected profit approaches $2.5 million.\nThe model reflects realistic commercial dynamics: early losses driven by onboarding costs, gradual patient uptake, and treatment persistence leading to sustained revenue growth. The cost plateau demonstrates diminishing acquisition expenses as market saturation approaches. Overall, the therapy achieves profitability within approximately two years, with strong profit growth through year five, supporting a compelling economic case for expanding osteoporosis treatment to previously under-identified missed high-risk populations.\n\n\nShow code\n# Time-series figure:revenue, cost, and profit\nfinancial_plot &lt;- commercial_df %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(revenue, cost, profit), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = Value, color = Metric)) +  \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"revenue\" = \"#4A0072\", \"cost\" = \"#9A4EAE\", \"profit\" = \"purple\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +  # format with commas\n  labs(\n    title = \"Revenue, Cost, and Profit Over Time\",\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"USD ($)\",\n    color = \"Metric\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\nfinancial_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Phase 2 simulations clearly demonstrate that earlier identification of high-risk patients through improved screening, combined with timely initiation of OsteoGuard therapy, can meaningfully prevent fractures and slow the progression of osteoporosis. In our simulated cohort, patients receiving treatment showed up to a 5.4% increase in lumbar spine BMD over 24 months, compared with a 1.6% gain or slight decline in low-adherence and control groups, respectively. Even partial adherence or early discontinuation conferred measurable benefit, highlighting the clinical value of targeting treatment to the right population.\nFrom a commercial perspective, this represents a substantial market opportunity. By expanding screening and driving uptake among eligible patients, OsteoGuard could capture a growing share of the addressable population, generating significant revenue and profit per patient while delivering tangible health benefits. Running an aggressive early-screening campaign, including physician outreach, patient education, and targeted risk-assessment programs, could accelerate identification of missed high-risk adults and maximize therapy adoption. Such initiatives would help reach the untapped portion of the market, ensuring that high-risk individuals who would otherwise remain undetected have the opportunity to benefit from treatment. The simulations underscore that therapies with preventative potential—when combined with strategic patient identification and proactive outreach—can both improve outcomes and unlock meaningful commercial value, establishing a compelling case for investment in screening programs, adherence support, and market rollout strategies.\n\n\nReferences\nAlendronate Prices, Coupons, Copay & Patient Assistance.
